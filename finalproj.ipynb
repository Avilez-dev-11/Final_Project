(293 additional authors not shown)\n\n\"Pretrained language models have become a cornerstone of modern natural language processing (NLP) pipelines because they often produce better performance from smaller quantities of labeled data. The development of ELMo, ULMFiT (Howard and Ruder, 2018), GPT (Radford et al., 2018), and BERT led to the widespread use of pretrained models as an initialization for finetuning on downstream tasks.\"\n\n\"The subsequent finding that pretrained language models can perform useful tasks without\nany additional training) further demonstrated their utility. In addition, the empirical observation that a language model’s performance tends to increase as the model is made larger—sometimes predictably and sometimes suddenly has led to a  trend of increasing scale. Apart from environmental concerns, the costs of training large language models (LLMs) are only affordable for well-resourced organizations.\"\n\n\"As a result, the majority of the research community has been excluded from the development of LLMs. This exclusion has had concrete consequences; for example, most LLMs are primarily trained on English-language text (with notable exceptions in Chinese and Korean).\n\n\"BLOOM is a 176 billion parameter language model trained on 46 natural languages and 13 programming languages that was developed and released by a collaboration of hundreds of researchers. The compute for training BLOOM was provided through a French public grant from GENCI and IDRIS, leveraging IDRIS’ Jean Zay supercomputer. To build BLOOM, the authors undertook a thorough design process for each of its components, including the training dataset, model architecture and training objective, and engineering strategy for distributed learning. The authors also performed an analysis of the model’s capabilities. Their overall aim is not only to publicly release a large-scale multilingual language model with performance comparable to recently developed systems, but also to document the coordinated process that went into its development. The purpose of this paper is to provide a high-level overview of these design steps while referencing the individual reports they produced over the course of developing BLOOM.\"\n\nhttps://arxiv.org/abs/2211.05100","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"#4th row, 1st column   \n\ndf.iloc[21,0]","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-12-12T18:24:06.181785Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-12-12T18:24:06.182686Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-12-12T18:24:06.188424Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-12-12T18:24:06.182651Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-12-12T18:24:06.187518Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#Social Limitations of LLM Development\n\n\"While the continued increase in the size of large language models has resulted in improvements across a wide range of tasks, it has also exacerbated issues with their development and use. The computational expense of large models also prohibits the majority of the research community from participating in their development, evaluation and routine use. Moreover, the computational costs have also lead to concerns about the carbon footprint stemming from the training and use of large language models, and existing carbon footprint studies have likely under-estimated emissions. Contributing to an increase in the global carbon footprint exacerbates climate change which most severely affects already-marginalized communities. Furthermore, the concentration of resources within a handful of (typically industrial) institutions with primarily technical expertise hinders prospects for an inclusive, collaborative, and reliable governance of the technology.\"\n\n\"Despite the substantial social dangers in allowing this technology to be developed unilaterally by corporations, EleutherAI was the only non-corporate entity outside of China that was developing large language models before the BigScience Workshop was convened.\"\n\nhttps://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.05100.pdf","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import torch","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-12-12T18:20:26.031962Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-12-12T18:20:26.032338Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-12-12T18:20:29.519878Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-12-12T18:20:26.032312Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-12-12T18:20:29.518978Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#Ethical Considerations within BigScience \n\n\"In order to acknowledge and start addressing social limitations of LLM development within BigScience, the workshop relied on a collaboratively designed Ethical Charter and original research on applicable regulations in jurisdictions outside of the US to guide its choices throughout the project.

Each of these values are showcased in different ways in the dataset curation, modeling, engineering, evaluation, and other social impact (throughout) aspects of the project.\"\n\n\"BLOOM was trained on the ROOTS corpus, a composite collection of 498 Hugging Face datasets amounting to 1.61 terabytes of text that span 46 natural languages and 13 programming languages.\"\n\nMOTIVATION - Under-valued \"Data Work\"-“High-quality” data for as little cost \n\n\"The disconnect between developers and (in)voluntary users of the technology is particularly apparent in the curation of the datasets that have supported recent large-scale machine learning projects, where intentional “Data work” is generally under-valued.\"\n\n\"In the context of LLMs, this tendency is exemplified by a range of heuristics-based filtering approaches that prioritize getting as much “high-quality” data for as little cost as possible over engaging with the needs—and rights—of data subjects, where quality is commonly defined as maximizing performance on downstream tasks while occasionally removing content deemed offensive by the developers.\"\n\nLANGUAGE CHOICES\n\n\"These considerations led us to an incremental process for choosing which languages were to be included in the corpus. The authors started with a list of eight of the world’s largest languages by number of speakers for which they did active outreach in the\nearly stages of the project to invite fluent speakers to join the data efforts. Then, on the recommendation of language communities they expanded Swahili in the original selection to the category of Niger-Congo languages, and Hindi and Urdu to Indic languages.\n\n\"Finally, the authors proposed that any group of 3 or more participants fluent in an additional language could add it to the supported list if they would commit to selecting sources and guiding processing choices in the language in order to avoid common issues with corpora selected through automatic language identification without specific language expertise.\"\n\n\"QUALITY\" FILTERING: TEXT PRODUCED by Humans For HUMANS \n\n\"After obtaining the text, we found that most of the sources contained some amount of text that was not naturallanguage, for example preprocessing errors, SEO pages, or spam (including pornographic spam).\"\n\n\" In order to filter non-natural language, the authors defined a set of quality indicators, where high-quality text is defined as “written by humans for humans”, without distinction of content (as they wanted content selection to exclusively be the domain of the more accountable human source selection) or a priori judgments of grammaticality.\"\n\nhttps://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.05100.pdf","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Set up the GPU device\ndevice = torch.device(\"cuda\")","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-12-12T18:20:36.302834Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-12-12T18:20:36.303993Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-12-12T18:20:36.308287Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-12-12T18:20:36.303956Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-12-12T18:20:36.30725Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#Downloading the model bigscience/bloom-1b7","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"#By Man of the year https://www.kaggle.com/code/manwithaflower/bloom-1b7-gsm8k\n\nfrom transformers import BloomTokenizerFast, BloomForCausalLM\n\ntokenizer = BloomTokenizerFast.from_pretrained(\"bigscience/bloom-1b7\")\nmodel = BloomForCausalLM.from_pretrained(\"bigscience/bloom-1b7\")","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-12-12T18:20:46.903655Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-12-12T18:20:46.904344Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-12-12T18:21:28.65283Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-12-12T18:20:46.904311Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-12-12T18:21:28.651923Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#PROMPTS\n \n\"Based on recent research on the impact of prompting on language model performance, the authors decided to build a language model evaluation suite that allowed them to vary both the basic task data as well as the prompting that is used to contextualize the task. Their prompts were developed prior to BLOOM’s release, and did not undergo any a priori refinement using models. That is, the prompts they used in their evaluation are ones that humans believed were a reasonable way to solicit the desired task behavior from a language model. Their goal for designing prompts in this way is to simulate realistic zero-shot or one-shot results that a new user could expect from BLOOM. This is in contrast to presenting best-case performances that might result from multiple rounds of trial-and-error on prompt design.\"\n\n\"The authors chose to report the former because the latter is harder to reproduce systematically, is arguably a less representative picture of how the model works in the average setting, and is not representative of true zero-shot learning where no labeled data is available. They generated multiple prompts per task using promptsource.\"\n\n\"They followed the procedure, in which prompt generation is crowd-sourced, and thus they saw substantial variety in length and style across prompts. To improve quality and clarity, multiple peer reviews were performed on each prompt for artifacts and consistency.\"\n\n\"They also generated prompts for many tasks that are not included in this paper due to resource constraints.

The two major problems observed, particularly in the zero-shot setting, are (i) over-generation and (ii) not producing the correct language (an obvious prerequisite for a good translation).
